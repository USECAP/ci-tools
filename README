Requirements
------------

You need Python 3.5 or later to run ci_tools

In Ubuntu, Mint and Debian you can install Python 3 like this:

    $ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip

For other Linux flavors, OS X and Windows, packages are available at

  http://www.python.org/getit/

Quick start
-----------

ci_tools can be installed using pip:

    $ pip3 install --user -U .

If you want to run the latest version of the code, you can install from git:

    $ pip3 install --user -U git@gitlab.com:code-intelligence/ci-frontend.git

If you want to install the binaries in a specific folder:
    $ python setup.py install --install-scripts /path/to/bin
Note, that the path needs to be in $PATH before running/testing the tools

If you are a developer, you should install this in editable mode:

    $ python setup.py develop

For testing please execute after installing:

    $ python setup.py pytest

If you want to see the code coverage, just run:
    $ pytest --cov

    Before running pytest once, you need to run the pytest from setup to fulfil
    all pytest requirements

Note that in all cases ~/.local/bin needs to be in $PATH
